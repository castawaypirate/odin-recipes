		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>A Greek salad is a vibrant and refreshing Mediterranean dish that embodies the essence of summer on a plate. This classic recipe features a harmonious combination of crisp, fresh ingredients. Crisp cucumbers, plump, ripe tomatoes, and pungent red onions are skillfully chopped and mixed with briny Kalamata olives and creamy feta cheese. The salad is further elevated by aromatic oregano, zesty lemon juice, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, infusing each bite with a burst of flavor. The result is a delightful medley of textures and tastes, with the colorful vegetables providing a crunchy contrast to the richness of the cheese and olives. Greek salad is not just a dish; it's a celebration of the Mediterranean's sun-soaked flavors and the perfect accompaniment to any meal, offering a taste of Greece's culinary heritage</p>
